			Veronica from Goulash Galley in Tharwa knew exactly what she wanted for the kitchen's logo when she contacted JUX. Armed with examples and mock-ups, Veronica was hoping for quick delivery of the final design.  She wasn't disappointed. 
			<br><br>
			The logo and wordmark, inspired by Hungarian folk art, culture and colours, came together in under a month. With Jarryd working closely with Veronica the whole time. Collaborating to get things just right. 
			<br><br>
			While the whole process took little more than three weeks,  the first drafts by the JUX team didn't necessarily hit the mark with Veronica. Luckily JUX's collaborative and user-centred design approach meant this didn't slow the process down. By checking in with Veronica early we were able to course-correct and get the project back on track to deliver the design Veronica wanted, just as quickly as she hoped.  
			<br><br>
			The final logo draws inspiration from Hungarian folk art and utilises strong but almost monochromatic colours that still meet Australian Web Content Accessibility contrast Guidelines (WCAG).
