            JUX is on the southside! Of Canberra that is. 
            Although we're Canberra based, we're happy to help you with your design requirements anywhere in the world. 
            Outside of COVID lockdown, we're more than happy to meet up with you for coffee anywhere in the region. Until lockdown ends, we're still happy to meet for virtual coffee, no matter where you are. 
          </p>

            Note: Our founders, Amy and Jarryd, only speak English (for now).<br>
