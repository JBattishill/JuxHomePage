          <p class text-sm>I was not able to attend classes on week 1 and missed the class discussion on Portfolios, Kylie and Mikaela were both aware of this.</p>
          <p>
            I have chosen to reflect on a time when I have networked with the Business Area of a client for my design project at work.
            Before the event, I was very excited and hopeful, I love the idea of meeting new people, especially in a situation that’s directly connected to my goals. I do sometimes worry that I could make a fool of myself in front of future potential key players but that quickly passes.
            My feelings during the event fluctuated, I started very nervously, I usually do when I am in a situation where I don’t know many people, but I always find that once I’ve met a few people and started to learn about them I always settle down a bit and relax.
        </p>

          <p>
            I found the most valuable thing was getting to know the people behind the colleague or peer. I loved finding out about that person's hobbies, pets, interests, favourite travel destinations or what they do on weekends. To me, this builds real connections and helps both the conversation and the relationship go further than “what can you do for me?”
            I made connections with Product Owners, System Admins and staff who will use our new system, I also was able to forge deeper connections with colleagues from my team.
            For future networking events, I will look to engage a little earlier, and try not to be so nervous at the start of the event. I could also consider getting a conversation starter, maybe a badge that says “Ask me about my dog!”.

    <p class="mt-4 text-gray-600">
     <h4 class="text-xl font-bold sm:text-2xl">What I learned</h4>
            I learned a lot about myself and where I am actually at during the goal setting and personality tests of weeks 2 and 3. I found I was overconfident in a few areas. I also learned that my next career goal is not to become a UI/UX Designer, it is to become a Product Designer.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4 text-gray-600">
     <h4 class="text-xl font-bold sm:text-2xl">What I found useful</h4>            
            Skills audit and goal setting activities were very useful for me, as was the time tracking exercise.
            Most useful I would say is the final project as this allowed me to push myself to create a portfolio using techniques I hadn’t tried yet.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4 text-gray-600">      
      <h4 class="text-xl font-bold sm:text-2xl">What held me back</h4>
            A significant personal situation affected me this semester which led to me missing some classes and the Networking event. I will also admit, that I underestimated how difficult this class would be which led to bad time management for completing the first assignment. 
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4 text-gray-600">
      <h4 class="text-xl font-bold sm:text-2xl">How could I improve my outcomes next semester</h4>            
            I will be taking a break over Winter and potentially Semester 2 to have my full attention available for my significant personal situation. I will also take all of my classes seriously for the rest of my degree.
    </p>
    <p class="mt-4 text-gray-600">
      <h4 class="text-xl font-bold sm:text-2xl">What I hope to build on in future units</h4>                
            I want to continue to work on my growth mindset, a little ironic I know.
            This includes a focus on being better with my time management and an awareness of overconfidence. I also want to continue to develop my design skills using Adobe Creative Suite and coding skills in HTML, CSS, Javascript and Nunjucks.
