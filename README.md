## Goals

## Inspiration

I honestly didn't take much inspiration from anywhere except the 11ty/Tailwind template I used - https://jamstackthemes.dev/theme/11ty-landing-page/

I used the template in conjuction with components from www.hyper.ui. Everything else I built myself.

## Production Process
I started with building out the Index page, and then expanding to add multiple pages, one with children.

### Lessons learned
**Tailwind is mobile FIRST** and needs to coded as such, I built all of my pages out as Desktop view forgetting to check mobile size and found my work was broken on mobile after a few days of coding.

I started to use the Safari Developer tools for easy checks as I go and enjoyed learning how to code for mobile first.

**I love SSGs and Tailwind!**
I am so happy with how this turned out and I honestly feel so proud that I could produce something so close to professional quality.


### P.S. I even got my emails working with an email DNS-MX.
